# Description
A simplistic racing game in which the player drives a car and switches between left and right lanes to avoid other 
obstacles in his way. The player has 3 lives and loses a life if the car hits one of them. After losing 1 life, the
level reastarts; after losing all the 3 lives, the game ends. The higher the level, the more obstacles will be spawned. Every level has different shaped obstacles: level 1 has the easiest to avoid, level 5, the largest and hardest to avoid.
